- a personal project, which means hosting (server + database) has to be your own, unique
- identify favourite sites for articles which don't have rss available
- scrape data from sites upto the article already feeded
- send them to telegram
- add a number like 1.1 where 1 is site name and 1 is article feeded in which user can do '/done 1.1' meaning that
user has read that article
- a user can see past fetched articles by doing '/past' which shows past articles that has not been read
- a user can also do '/past done' meaning that shows the articles that has already been read
- /fetch: to fetch the articles


iteration 2
- /list : list all the sites that are being used for article fetch
- '/block 1': to block a site from being fetched
- '/unblock 1': to unblock
- '/fetch 1': fetch articles from site 1 only
- '/past 1': already read articles from site 1
- '/help': to show all the commands

iteration 3
- add a cron job to do auto fetch periodically, but then it creates a problem to keep the server running so maybe 
not implementing this

- idk it works and it works
- simply import to your group or send message to BOT itself and then use that CHAT_ID in bot.py
- Host it as per the instructions if provided
